Project Title: Serverless Weather Forecasting Pipeline
Overview

This project implements a serverless, automated weather data processing system on AWS. It fetches raw weather data from an external API, processes it, aggregates it hourly, stores it in DynamoDB, and exposes it via a REST API.

Architecture Diagram

AWS Services Utilized

S3: Storage for raw and processed data

Lambda: Functions for data collection, processing, and API handling

EC2: Aggregation script for hourly data processing

DynamoDB: Storage for aggregated data

API Gateway: Exposes the /weather endpoint

EventBridge: Triggers for scheduled tasks

IAM: Roles and permissions management

Data Flow

EventBridge triggers the Weather Collector Lambda every hour.

The Lambda fetches data from the external weather API.

Raw data is stored in the S3 Raw Bucket.

The Weather Processor Lambda is triggered by new data in the raw bucket, processes it, and stores the processed data in the S3 Processed Bucket.

The EC2 Aggregation Script reads processed data, aggregates it hourly, and stores it in DynamoDB.

The API Handler Lambda serves data from DynamoDB through the /weather endpoint exposed via API Gateway.

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecasting-pipeline.git
cd weather-forecasting-pipeline


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Deploy AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform (provide links to templates or scripts).

Configure IAM roles and permissions as per the docs/setup-guide.md.

Usage

To fetch weather data for a specific hour:

curl https://api.yourdomain.com/weather?datehour=2025_08_27_05

🖼️ Architecture Diagram

Use Lucidchart or draw.io to create a diagram representing the architecture. Here's a textual representation:

[EventBridge] → [Weather Collector Lambda] → [S3 Raw Bucket] → [Weather Processor Lambda] → [S3 Processed Bucket] → [EC2 Aggregation Script] → [DynamoDB] → [API Gateway] → [API Handler Lambda] → [Users]


Ensure each component is labeled clearly, and use arrows to indicate the flow of data and triggers.

📚 Documentation

In the docs/ directory, provide detailed setup and deployment guides:

setup-guide.md: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project, including AWS resource deployment, IAM role configuration, and environment variable setup.

architecture.md: Detailed explanation of each component in the architecture, its purpose, and how it interacts with other components.
